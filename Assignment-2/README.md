This is Assignment 2 for COL334 course
This assignment contains 2 source files - clientApp.py and serverApp.py.
clientApp.py contains code for the client side of the application.
serverApp.py contains code for the server side of the application.

Steps to start and execute the application: - 
1). First start the serverApp.py using the terminal command - "python serverApp.py". 
2). Then in another terminal run the clientApp.py using terminal command - "python clientApp.py".
3). The client side will ask for username, IP address, sending port and receiving port numbers through the terminal.
4). After the above details are provided, connection is established with the server.
5). You can run clientApp.py on multiple terminals. These will act as different clients.
6). Make sure you do not repeat the same port numbers for different sockets.
7). Make sure you are in the correct directory.
8). The clients can then send messages to one another using "@[recipient] [message]" format.
